# HTML Radio Tuner

HTML Radio Tuner is a web-based radio tuner that allows users to listen to their favorite stations with a realistic radio interface. It also displays metadata when available such as the song title and artist. 
To load your stations, create an .xlsx file in your spreadsheet program of choice and add the stations' name, frequency, and stream url in the same style as the provided sample. 
After adding all your stations to your file, open the radio-tuner.html file in your web browser, upload your file, and tune to your favorite station. 

Update: You can now try it for yourself at http://wengland02.github.io/html-radio-tuner-web.

I recommend using Chromium and Firefox based browsers for this application due to known bugs in Safari. HLS and ICY metadata supported. Code generated using Grok 3 from xAI.
